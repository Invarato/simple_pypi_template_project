# Name of your project (example according to this example project folder: Simple PyPI Template)
Short description about your project

This is a template, maybe you do not need all of these points, or you need add new ones.

**Note:** if you are reading this from PyPI this is only an example of this template, you do no install this project with 
PIP because it is only a folder with templates (this not have any functionally). To get full template go to 
https://github.com/Invarato/simple_pypi_template_project and pull or download project folder that it is the 
full template. For more information, tricks, easy steps to create your own Python module and upload to PyPi go to
